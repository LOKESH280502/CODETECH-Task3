OVERVIWE:
Objective: Develop a simple image classification model to recognize handwritten digits using the load_digits dataset from scikit-learn. This task illustrates the process of training a machine learning model for image classification without relying on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow.

Key Steps
Dataset Selection:

The load_digits dataset consists of 8x8 pixel grayscale images representing digits (0-9). Each image is flattened into a 64-dimensional array for model training.
Data Preparation:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, typically with 80% for training and 20% for testing.
Model Training:

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is chosen due to its effectiveness for smaller datasets. The model is trained using the training data.
Making Predictions:

The trained model predicts labels for the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Performance metrics are calculated, including:
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each digit.
Confusion Matrix: Visualization of true vs. predicted labels.
Visualization:

A sample digit image from the test set is displayed alongside the model's prediction to provide a visual validation of performance.
Expected Output
Classification Report: Detailed metrics for each digit, indicating the modelâ€™s accuracy and effectiveness.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that shows the performance of the classification model, highlighting where it made correct and incorrect predictions.
Sample Image Display: An image of a handwritten digit with the model's predicted label, allowing for visual confirmation.
Summary
This task demonstrates a straightforward approach to image classification using classical machine learning techniques. It highlights essential processes such as data handling, model training, evaluation, and visualization, providing a foundation for more complex image classification tasks in the future.
